#### [Encrypted Media Extensions (DRM)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Media/EME)

A binary plugin (closed-source) is shipped with Firefox since v38. It enables playback of encrypted media and lets you use e.g. Netflix without Microsoft Silverlight. To completely remove the plugin you would have to install an [EME-free](http://download.cdn.mozilla.net/pub/firefox/releases/latest/win32-EME-free/) build of Firefox.

#### Important changes
0.1 - initial commit

0.2 - removed mention of ```Reader mode``` (it doesn't leak data\*) and added ```browser.safebrowsing.remoteLookups``` (it is confrmed to stop leaking data to Google while keeping Safe Browsing on\*)

0.3 ```browser.safebrowsing.remoteLookups``` turned out to do nothing after all. Actually, it was [removed](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=388652). Requests to the Google Safe Search API are not made often, so at first I thought they were gone.

\* tested using Fiddler
